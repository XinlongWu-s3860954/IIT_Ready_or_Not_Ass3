                        <p>
                            Throughout the team, we have strong leaders and meticulous executors.
                            We also have attentive defender, which is already the quality
                            needed for a potential team. According to the results of the
                            Myers-Briggs test for each person in the team, we are delighted
                            that each of us has a different personality. There are defender,
                            entrepreneur, and consul among us. They are very well organised
                            when they get toghter. They are also willing to lend a helping
                            hand when their teammates are in trouble. This is why they are
                            the one of the best choices to be a co-workers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In fact, our team is not mature enough, that means we need to
                            keep learning, so it is also particularly important to know
                            the learning habits of each team member. We are pleased to find
                            that the learning styles of our team members cover all three
                            learning styles: visual, tactile and auditory. We are pleased
                            to see that the learning styles of our team members cover all
                            three learning styles: visual, tactile and auditory. Each of
                            us has different ways and methods of acquiring knowledge. When
                            such people form a team, the team can acquire and develop knowledge
                            from different ways and means at the same time. Consequently, this
                            team can develop and mature much faster than others.

                                an interest in cybersecurity and computers in
                                general and decided to take the IT Bachelor
                                course with Rmit University. This is my first
                                year and first semester, so everything is new
                                to me! I love building computers and putting
                                together things and love to find out more about
                                how things work together.

                                The role of software developer and engineer is to focus on the application of principles
                                regarding engineering to software development, analysing what is needed to bring the
                                idea to life. Through his role, he develops the idea and the prototype, to demonstrate
                                the practicality and usefulness of the idea. The aspect undertaken by Malik is crucial
                                to the success of the project, as he must make sure all aspects of the theoretical side
                                are implementeed into the prototype.

                                My name is Adrian Ghitoaica, I am Romanian,
                                currently undergoing my bachelor’s in
                                construction management (Honours) in second
                                year, I can speak Romanian, and I like outdoor
                                activities like fishing, camping. I am pursuing
                                my first degree and am set to graduate by 2024
                                if everything goes well. I believe an understanding
                                of IT will support me in future, and enhance my
                                skillset, hence choosing this course.

                                The role of Adrian is the Project Administrator, due to the focus on the role to define
                                the aims, roles and timeframe of the project. Through defining the key aspects, the
                                project can pursue itself naturally, with the set timeframe for job completion avoiding
                                a delay in completion. The timeframe aspect is core to development as it ensures each
                                member remains disciplined in their roles and completes their workload in the specified
                                time. Therefore, each member is important to the success and longevity of the project.

                                Ihthisham is the Project Advisor, due to his focus being on the risk aspect of the
                                project. However, Ihthisham has been crucial in the early stages of the project,
                                forwarding the initial idea to the team of ReadyDiet, demonstrating initiative early on
                                in the project. With the knowledge of this team member, the project can excel and turn
                                to reality, as Ihthisham can advise us of risks or problems along the way which may
                                arise internally within the project.

                            other hand, are more involved in writing documentation.

                                    have eaten, all food you have bought and all food you have
                                    stored away. Another cool feature of this software is the
                                    recipe lookup, it checks to see what foods are in the inventory
                                    and scores the web for recipes that can be made with what’s
                                    available This software is a sort of food organizing, monitoring
                                    and developing software which helps users watch their calorie intake,
                                    cook healthy meals and know what they are missing in their fridges or
                                    storages.

                                    This project will help millions if not billions of people. Everyone
                                    wants to eat healthy and be the perfect weight and make sure they are
                                    getting enough nutrients, however not everyone has the time to figure
                                    out a plan or has the money to afford a nutritional expert to guide
                                    them. Just opening this application and adding your food items that
                                    you eat throughout the day is enough to tell you if you are going
                                    over your limits or not, making it 10x easier than doing the research
                                    and paying a professional. Furthermore, keeping track of the items,
                                    you buy and what you are missing for your plans helps you organize
                                    and possibly save money on certain food aspects. This software will
                                    be the go-to application to figure out a 5-star meal plan and ingredient

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    There are already apps that help with dietary needs and organizing fridges and
                                    pantries such as Fridge Pal, fridge check, calorie counter app, Lite n’ easy. These
                                    are some of many of our competitors in our current market however they do not and
                                    will not provide the services and extra utilities that come with our ReadyDiet
                                    software. We gain a long advantage by combining both the likes of a dietary
                                    application and a food product organizing application both into one software for all
                                    your food product needs. Another large point of difference is that many of these
                                    applications require confusing and sometimes annoying process not to mention the
                                    costs to keep these applications running as well.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The core aim of the project is to develop a tool which is found in most households
                                    domestically, essentially the creation of a barcode scanner integrated into a
                                    fridge. The product monitors the consumption experienced by the user, and in turn
                                    allows the user to monitor the amount of calories they are consuming, which is
                                    especially useful for those engaged in physical exercise and demand an accurate
                                    measurement of calories consumed. In turn, the long-term aim is to see this product
                                    marketed not only to a small group of physical exercise enthusiasts but instead to
                                    the entire domestic market as a whole, to ensure that the general public maintain
                                    high health standards for themselves.

                                    <h4>Finding the tools to create the project</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The first goal to enforce the idea, is to find the tools needed to create such a
                                    product. Through finding what is required to bring the project to life, the team can
                                    then go ahead and develop the technology and find suitable interfaces which make the
                                    use of the product easiest for the consumer. When the right tools are provided, then
                                    the project can be pursued at the most efficient rate, which can lower the cost and
                                    time involved with the creation of the project.

                                    <h4>Ascertaining the target market / demographic</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The second goal for the project is to find the demographic which the product is
                                    targeted towards. Through finding the target market, the team can come to a
                                    conclusion whether the product is financially viable upon completion, and determine
                                    if there is enough demand for the product at the end. Through finding out the
                                    market, the product itself can be marketed towards those most likely to buy it, and
                                    in turn raise revenue. Therefore, finding the core demographic is key to the success
                                    of the product.

                                    <h4>Creating the software required</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    Through creating the software, the team is able to test ‘loosely’ if the concept
                                    will work prior to the integration of the scanner into a physical fridge. This goal
                                    must be reached before the project can progress, as without cleaning up the software
                                    side of things, the physical prototype success will be unattainable. Therefore, the
                                    software must be complete, for the project to enter its next phase of development.

                                    <h4>Creating physical prototypes</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The creation of physical prototypes is imperative to the success of the project, and
                                    will be completed upon the creation of the software, which will aim to make user
                                    interface easy. The physical prototype will be in the form of creation of the
                                    barcode scanner first, which will provide details of the food scanned, and show the
                                    calories and nutritional statistics of the scanned food. The final form of the
                                    prototype will be implementation into a fridge interface, as the product must be
                                    integrated without appearing too ‘clunky’ or unappealing. Therefore, the success of
                                    this goal is important to the project in its entirety.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The project will be complete once all patent and trademarks are attained, and the
                                    product can now be shown to major electronics brands, and marketed to be integrated
                                    into their existing products, such as Hisense and Samsung. Through achieving the
                                    implementation of the product into a widespread major brand, the product can achieve
                                    its end goal of the lifespan and return finances to the project owners. The market
                                    implementation will be difficult, but once achieved, mark the end of the project,
                                    and the success of it at the same time.

                                    Python will be ReadyDiet’s main software language. It’s a high-level programming
                                    language and is highly recommend for many programmers out there. Its highly
                                    interpreted with built in structures and is used for building websites, automated
                                    tasks Aswell as software which make it a attractive development language. Since
                                    python is free to use no software licenses would be needed. Python can be used to
                                    make a variety of different programs into one software which makes it ideal for our
                                    project since there are a few integrations such as the barcode scanner and the
                                    storage system Aswell as the product lookup aspect. Python can be used for mobile,
                                    web and desktop applications which Is a requirement for our software as it is
                                    supposed to operate on not only mobile devices but also desktops, laptops and common
                                    operating systems. Python can actually be used for quick prototyping Aswell.

                                    Python will save us time and will help us create high-level software
                                    <br><br>
                                    Our team has used proton.io to create mockup software to show the aspects and points
                                    of potential that the product will achieve.

                                        As I am the lead software designer and developer, I have taken responsibility to
                                        create mockups as shown of the software on a phone application and how it would
                                        look like.
                                        <br><br>
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;The first stages of the mockups, from ReadyDiet beta 1.0 - 1.2 are
                                        being tested by only the developers including me. The reason being that this is
                                        only the first design stage and will only need to create ideas and designs on
                                        this stage.
                                        <br><br>
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the ReadyDiet Beta stages will be tested by at least
                                        5-10 different families. The families will have sizes including families with 3
                                        members to families with 12 members all together. This is to test the app's
                                        limits and how much data and how fast it can process and save all diet
                                        information on a family. Some issues such as the application slowing down due to
                                        the number of data being inputted or it can crash. The families will also be of
                                        different backgrounds and cultures. This is to test whether the application can
                                        pick up diverse ranges of foods in our databases. These tests will also help us
                                        fill in any missing items into our database.

                                        <br><br>
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;We will find these users to test our application by asking randoms
                                        on the street if they are interested with the benefit of having a free diet
                                        monitoring application to use early. If the users get really hard to find, we
                                        will work with research recruitment agencies to fulfill our tests. Ofcourse the
                                        software will be limited to its features however more beta roll outs will
                                        continue and more tests will be done to improve our application.

                            There are roughly three kinds of major outputs from our project. Software should be our
                            primary
                            output, which includes, but is not limited to, customer-side applications in the user's
                            personal
                            device (e.g. smartphone/smartwatch). There is also business-side software used by production
                            merchants/manufacturers. In order to enable the software to read the required information
                            from
                            the QR code/barcode, we also plan to offer a public protocol specification for storing the
                            information that we need in a specific format. Because it is a public protocol
                            specification, it
                            can be easily reused by other products, thus further helping us to create a commercial
                            ecosystem. In order to promote our software more widely so that it can reach more embedded
                            devices (e.g. refrigerators). We may also need to experiment with hardware products that
                            allow
                            embedded devices to install or interact with our software.

                            For the sake of time, we have only planned the most major programs so far. In this
                            development
                            cycle, we are planning to implement a user application for IOS first, which will be called
                            ReadyDiet. After that, we should also need to build the corresponding back-end services for
                            ReadyDiet. So far, we have discussed and identified some basic information about our
                            application. For example what features it will contains. The colour style of its theme. The
                            development language and the technology stack etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;
                            We discussed the features that should be included in our application, firstly the core base
                            function of our application - the scan code, which should be extremely basic and essential.
                            Then
                            we needed to parse and store the information that was scanned. And as mentioned in the
                            project
                            plan, the information will be analysed to remind the user.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;
                            We initially planned to use Python for our application development as it was simple
                            enough and
                            would save us a lot of time. But we learnt that python is not suitable for developing
                            IOS
                            applications. So we had to use Swift to develop the app for IOS, which fortunately was
                            just as
                            simple. In the meantime, we plan to use python to develop future back-end services. But
                            in the
                            end we discovered that python has a Kivy library that allows us to develop IOS
                            applications
                            using python. So we finally returned to our initial decision to develop the whole
                            project in
                            python.

                                We also considered whether to use Jira or Trello for project management, but after
                                careful
                                discussion we felt that although it was necessary, we could not use it yet, at least at
                                the
                                beginning of the project. We plan to use Trello to manage the project when it is well
                                underway.

                                We are currently working on a prototype of the application - what it will looks like and
                                how it
                                responds to the user's actions. Almost all of us had no experience in prototyping, so to
                                simplify our work, we chose proto.io instead of figma. proto.io is simpler and allows us
                                to drag
                                and drop the corresponding components directly to design

                                We are all well aware that this is a huge project and if we need to hand over the
                                project to
                                another team at the end of this term. Then the most important thing is that we need to
                                make sure
                                the other team knows what our project is about, our project plan and the current
                                progress of our
                                project. Therefore, as can be expected, we will have many synchronous handover meetings.
                                During
                                the meeting , we will explain our project goals, starting from how we came up with the
                                idea for
                                the project, to how it finally takes shapes. Next we will try to explain our project
                                plan and
                                the current progress of this project. In the meantime, we will gradually hand over the
                                resources
                                we have for this project during this process, such as the github repository, the
                                proto.io
                                organisation and related documentation, etc. Then we will give the new team some time to
                                work
                                independently on our project, during this time, they are allowed to ask us any questions
                                they
                                met about the project to ensure a smooth handover.

                                If I were one of the people who took over. I hope I can be taught to understand what
                                each line
                                of code does. Of course I know this is not possible. Anyway, I hope that during the
                                handover
                                process I can quickly become familiar with every detail of the whole project. Thus I can
                                start
                                the subsequent work better.

                        In this project, we used Teams as the main team communication tool. Basically all communication
                        takes place in teams. We basically meet twice a week, the first time on Wednesday, which is an
                        offline meeting where we synchronise each of us in the classroom with our individual progress
                        from the previous week and work together for two hours. Then a second meeting is booked for the
                        week, which is usually on a Friday afternoon.
                        <br><br>
                        In the second meeting on Friday afternoon we will summarise our work for the week and then plan
                        everyone's tasks for the following week. This is a short meeting and we will record the meeting
                        for review purposes. In week 13, both meetings became online meetings. As Assignment 3 closes at
                        the end of the week, our Wednesday meeting briefly summarised the final work we needed to do for
                        Assignment 3. And there will be one final meeting at the end of the week.
                        <br><br>
                        During the course of the meetings, we did have people who were not able to attend because they
                        had other commitments. This is not avoided and our current solution is to skip the absentees for
                        the time being. Then use Teams to synchronise progress and assign tasks with the absent person
                        via messages.
